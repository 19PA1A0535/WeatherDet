# WeatherDet
By this, we can know weather information about location that you want.
If you are using weather APIs provided by any platform, you need to connect to their paid services to work with the weather APIs.
But if you use your web scraping skills, it will be free. So we used Beautifulsoap.
# Process
To get the live weather conditions of any city using Python, we first have to install the BeautifulSoup library in Python. We can easily install this Python library in your system by using the pip command:

pip install beautifulsoup4

After installing this library, you can now start with this task by importing the necessary Python libraries that we need for this task. After importing the libraries we need to scrape the weather updates of a city by searching about it on Google.
